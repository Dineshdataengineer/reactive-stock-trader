# TODO

- Portfolio view - handle failed quote
- Portfolio - failed order
- Order - failed state
- Portfolio order history


- Wire transfer functionality
- Liquidation process
- Limit orders
- Commissions
- Loyalty
- Portfolio search
- Provide per portfolio stream of order events to client

- CB and timeout on IEX (configuration)

CommonModels probably not a good pattern to follow due to code coupling across services.
